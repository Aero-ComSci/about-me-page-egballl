    <h2>Career Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Personal career goals: Success, a decent job and starting a family.<br>
      - I am hardworking, a problem solver, and a team player.<br>
      - My plans for achieving this goal would be getting my grades up and keeping them up. Applying to college, where my first choice would be to attend Berkely<br>
      - Most of these plans are just because in life as humans, we like money. I like money, so getting a job means getting money. "Money Good, I like Money!!" - Mr Crabs.
